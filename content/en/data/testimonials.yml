    response: It was enough to let go, to allow myself to be guided by the shaman
      Audrey, who carried to me to unsuspected corners of my soul. I came back
      from the healing soothed and transformed. Once healed, I understood the
      love received, and I understood the love I was able to give to others and
      receive. I felt clear like crystal.

    response: "Thanks, you so much, Audrey. That was so beautiful and so much
      needed. The entire healing made so much sense for me. This touched on all
      the missing joy, and I just cried and cried. The singing and all the
      sounds were so beautiful and fitting. You are doing great work. Your inner
      power and your open heart have the capacity to bring darkness into light,
      and that is an ultimate gift to share with the world. "

    response: "The care was powerful. Today I feel, the level of my energy seems
      freer. Thank you, Audrey for your enlightened accompaniment. Your voice
      takes us on an inner journey that plunges us into another space-time… We
      let ourselves be slowly rocked, you transport us to your magical universe,
      what happiness! The care we have received is a blessing, an experience to
      be renewed.” "

    response: "I had the pleasure to meet Audrey 5 years ago at a training of the
      Foundation for Shamanic  Studies.I was touched by her very unique way of
      feeling the work. Along the years, I felt more and more her strength, her
      commitment to her path and how she offers her healing work to others with
      grace and beauty. Audrey is blessed with many talents that she expresses
      with deep love and faith. It is a pleasure, a joy and an honour to know
      her! "

    response: "With a sense of curiosity and excitement, I had my first shamanic
      session at Audrey's shamanic office. The mixture of her pleasant-sounding
      singing and the drum puts me in absolute relaxation. I can only recommend
      such a session to everyone; It's worth an experience. I wish Audrey many
      more satisfied customers!” "
