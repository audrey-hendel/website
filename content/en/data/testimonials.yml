    response: It was enough to let go, to allow myself to be guided by the shaman
      Audrey, who carried to me to unsuspected corners of my soul. I came back
      from the healing soothed and transformed. Once healed, I understood the
      love received, and I understood the love I was able to give to others and
      receive. I felt clear like crystal.

    response: "Thanks, you so much, Audrey. That was so beautiful and so much
      needed. The entire healing made so much sense for me. This touched on all
      the missing joy, and I just cried and cried. The singing and all the
      sounds were so beautiful and fitting. You are doing great work. Your inner
      power and your open heart have the capacity to bring darkness into light,
      and that is an ultimate gift to share with the world. "
