### The session


After explaining their issue, wishes or difficulties, the client usually lies down comfortably and

closes their eyes while the shamanic practitioner sings and drums. When the drumming/singing is

over, the client and the shamanic practitioner have time to exchange. Belief or faith play no role in

the healing or its effect.
