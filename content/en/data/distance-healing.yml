    **The session.** 

    After explaining their issue, wishes or difficulties, the client usually lies down comfortably and closes their eyes while the shamanic practitioner sings and drums. When the drumming/singing is over, the client and the shamanic practitioner have time to exchange. Belief or faith play no role in the healing or its effect.

    ### About shamanism


    In traditional indigenous cultures, shamans are regarded as community members who are able to heal and to be in contact with the  piritual world. Shamans lead healing rituals and perform an essential therapeutic and counselling role in case of diseases, disbalanced and challenging situations. They communicate valuable problem-solving and healing strategies to the community.Shamanism is effective, gentle and natural; it can bring knowledge, healing, empowerment and transformation. By providing holistic, systemic, and energetic methods to empower the client, shamanism is an alternative medicine par excellence. By “empower the client” we mean enhance immunity, strength, resistance, self-healing power, vitality, resiliency, inner joy and the ability to act for oneself and others. The effects are somatic, psychological, psychosocial, and energetic. Fully empowered clients typically find that their symptoms have naturally vanished, they feel confident and healthy, or they have learned to reframe their difficulties as an advantageous aspect of their personality and their life.

    **Communication and advertising** 



    Isn't it wonderful and miraculous to be able to help sentient beings in difficulty all over the planet? Digital advances, the use of English as a lingua franca, and shamanic collaboration with helping Spirits able us to act with compassion on an international level. In the face of the challenges that lie ahead, and our uncertain future, it is our responsibility to seize this opportunity to prepare the field and be ready to serve 



    Share about us and Let’s be happy with the people around you. Help us by talking about shamanism, our long-distance healing concept, our practitioners and about the alliance between power of the soul, joy and health. Shamanism can help in case of somatic, psychic, social difficulties, and emergencies. Shamanism is not only spiritually. Is an efficient but forgotten alternative medicine. Few know what shamanism means. The shamans are underrepresented in media, and popular culture is full of clichés. Few know the effectiveness, wisdom and beauty of shamanism, an ancestral method of knowledge, healing, empowerment, and transformation. 



    Help us to become visible and let people know we are here, ready to act and ready to help. 




    « It is not enough to be compassionate. You must act. » 

    Dalai Lama
