    text: >-
      <p>
      After studying <strong>philosophy, communication and psychology</strong> at a French university for ten years, 
      I trained and specialized in <strong>psychopathology</strong> and various psychotherapeutic approaches at a 
      professional school for alternative healthcare in Germany. My professional experience in 
      psychiatric hospitals for children and adults gave me a field-based orientation and the desire 
      to propose two complementary therapeutic approaches: <strong>shamanism and psychotherapy</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
      I live in Germany, where the status of healing practitioner (naturopath) with a specialization 
      as psychological counselor is recognized, validated by an exam, and supervised by the Ministry 
      of Health. I practice as a “Heilpraktikerin für Psychotherapie.” For more information about this 
      status and its legal background, please read the following section + details.
      </p>
      <p>
      I developed my <strong>healing and shamanic divination techniques</strong> with the FSSE, The Foundation for Shamanic 
      Studies Europe, a highly professional organization that is very close to my heart. The Foundation for 
      Shamanic Studies is a non-profit organization dedicated to the preservation, study and teaching of 
      shamanic knowledge for the welfare of the planet and its inhabitants. I follow the vision and 
      ethics of shamanism as taught by the Foundation. In addition, Tibetan Buddhism grounds and frames 
      my commitment to spirituality. My therapies are gentle, respectful of your wishes, and based on 
      universal compassion and a code of ethics for shamanic online sessions.
