Isn't it wonderful and miraculous to be able to help sentient beings in difficulty all over the planet? Digital advances, the use of English as a lingua franca, and shamanic collaboration with helping Spirits able us to act with compassion on an international level. In the face of the challenges that lie ahead, and our uncertain future, it is our responsibility to seize this opportunity to prepare the field and be ready to serve 

Share about us and Let’s be happy with the people around you. Help us by talking about shamanism, our long-distance healing concept, our practitioners and about the alliance between power of the soul, joy and health. Shamanism can help in case of somatic, psychic, social difficulties, and emergencies. Shamanism is not only spiritually. Is an efficient but forgotten alternative medicine. Few know what shamanism means. The shamans are underrepresented in media, and popular culture is full of clichés. Few know the effectiveness, wisdom and beauty of shamanism, an ancestral method of knowledge, healing, empowerment, and transformation. 

Help us to become visible and let people know we are here, ready to act and ready to help. 

« It is not enough to be compassionate. You must act. » 

Dalai Lama
