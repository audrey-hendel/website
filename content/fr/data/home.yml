      ### PSYCHOLOGICAL&nbsp;COUNSELOR &&nbsp;SHAMANIC HEALER


      
      After studying eight years **Philosophy and Psychology** at the French university, I trained  Psychopathology and various psychotherapeutic approaches in Germany. My professional       experience in psychiatric hospitals for children and adults has given me the field-bases approach  and the desire to propose a complementary therapeutic approach: the combination of  shamanism and psychotherapy. 

      I developed my healing and shamanic divination techniques with the FSSE, The Foundation for
      Shamanic Studies Europe, a highly professional organization that is very close to my heart. The
      Foundation for Shamanic Studies is a non-profit organisation dedicated to the preservation, study
      and teaching of shamanic knowledge for the welfare of the planet and its inhabitants. I follow the
      vision and ethics of shamanism as taught by the Foundation.

      In addition, Tibetan Buddhism grounds and frames my commitment to spirituality. My therapies
      are gentle, respectful of your wishes and based on an ethic of universal compassion.
      I live in Germany, where the status of healing practitioner (naturopathy) with a specialisation as
      psychological counselor is recognized, validated by a exam, and supervised by the Ministry of
      Health. I practice as “Heilpraktikerin für       Psychotherapie"
