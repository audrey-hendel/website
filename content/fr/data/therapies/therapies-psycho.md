  **Psycho-Shamanic Therapy**
    As a trained and certified healing practitioner for psychotherapy, the scope of my therapeutic
    spectrum allows me to diagnose and treat mental and psychiatric disorders, and to offer support,
    hope and perspective in cases of organic illness.
    
    My approach of mental health is free from rigid
    psychiatric categorisation and the psychotherapeutic bond is based on authenticity and
    unconditional positive appreciation. I treat clients with psycho-shamanic, short-term, client-centred and goal-oriented psychotherapy that can be repeated. Concretely, after having fixed a goal
    for the psychotherapy, the time of the therapy is freely divided in both approaches: psychotherapy
    and shamanic methods. I switch alternatively my focus on the intrapsychic process of the clients
    and on the energetic aspects. The integration of ancestral shamanic medicine into person-centred 
    humanistic interviews and exchanges leads to results that are faster, deeper, holistic, sustainable
    and in harmony with each clientâ€™s personal resources and own power. Together we search for
    empowerment and transformation of the self, which makes unhealthy and painful symptoms
    vanish. 
    
    In addition, clients learn through the therapy to recognise, embrace and implement newly
    gained psychological powers in their daily life and to engage actions and play roles in their
    community. My ongoing purpose is to help my clients lead autonomous and joyful lives without
    psychotherapy or dependencies.
