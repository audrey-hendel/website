**Clients.** Adults, children, couples, and families, experiencing
psychological and/or somatic difficulties.


**Awareness.** Self-reflection, willingness to change, openness and curiosity about psychology and shamanism are recommended for the healing process. Neither faith nor spirituality is required.


**Complementarity.** Shamanic and psycho-shamanic methods harmonize perfectly with medical, psychiatric- and psychotherapeutic approaches. I work in partnership with medical doctors. 


**Responsibility.** Psychotherapy and shamanic healing can bring challenging changes for you and those around you. We will work together to ensure that these changes are smooth and for the benefit of everyone involved. 


**Location.** In my office, at your own home, outdoors in nature, or in a care facility. Travel expenses will be charged. 


**Remote care/Distance healing.** Shamanic healing can also be done by videoconference or by phone. 


**Languages.** I speak French, English and German.


**Documentation.** You can read and get a copy of your patient record.
