    ### About shamanism

    In traditional indigenous cultures, shamans are regarded as community members who are able to heal and to be in contact with the  piritual world. Shamans lead healing rituals and perform an essential therapeutic and counselling role in case of diseases, disbalanced and challenging situations. They communicate valuable problem-solving and healing strategies to the community.Shamanism is effective, gentle and natural; it can bring knowledge, healing, empowerment and transformation. By providing holistic, systemic, and energetic methods to empower the client, shamanism is an alternative medicine par excellence. By “empower the client” we mean enhance immunity, strength, resistance, self-healing power, vitality, resiliency, inner joy and the ability to act for oneself and others. The effects are somatic, psychological, psychosocial, and energetic. Fully empowered clients typically find that their symptoms have naturally vanished, they feel confident and healthy, or they have learned to reframe their difficulties as an advantageous aspect of their personality and their life.

    ### The session

    After explaining their issue, wishes or difficulties, the client usually lies down comfortably and
    closes their eyes while the shamanic practitioner sings and drums. When the drumming/singing is
    over, the client and the shamanic practitioner have time to exchange. Belief or faith play no role in
    the healing or its effect.
