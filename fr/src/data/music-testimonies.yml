  response: Thanks, you so much, Audrey. That was so beautiful and so much needed. The entire healing made so much sense for me. This touched on all the missing joy, and I just cried and cried. The singing and all the sounds were so beautiful and fitting. You are doing great work. Your inner power and your open heart have the capacity to bring darkness into light, and that is an ultimate gift to share with the world.

  response: It was enough to let go, to allow myself to be guided by the shaman Audrey, who carried to me to unsuspected corners of my soul. I came back from the healing soothed and transformed. Once healed, I understood the love received, and I understood the love I was able to give to others and receive. I felt clear like crystal.

  response: The care was powerful. Today I feel, the level of my energy seems freer. Thank you, Audrey for your enlightened accompaniment. Your voice takes us on an inner journey that plunges us into another space-time… We let ourselves be slowly rocked, you transport us to your magical universe, what happiness! The care we have received is a blessing, an experience to be renewed.

  response: I had the pleasure to meet Audrey 5 years ago at a training of the Foundation for Shamanic Studies.I was touched by her very unique way of feeling the work. Along the years, I felt more and more her strength, her commitment to her path and how she offers her healing work to others with grace and beauty. Audrey is blessed with many talents that she expresses with deep love and faith. It is a pleasure, a joy and an honour to know her!

  response: With a sense of curiosity and excitement, I had my first shamanic session at Audrey's shamanic office. The mixture of her pleasant-sounding singing and the drum puts me in absolute relaxation. I can only recommend such a session to everyone; It's worth an experience. I wish Audrey many more satisfied customers!

  response: Wow, I have to admit it, it’s very relaxing. I wanted to have some answers to private questions, about my job and my private life. I’m satisfied! Audrey’s voice is like magic, as if fairies would fly and sing lullabies. I liked the lyre more than the drum, she felt thar quickly, she put the drum down and sang. So I think Audrey can adapt the session to each client and make the session very intense and personal.

  response: All therapy is like going into another universe, where I came back stronger for my daily life. I don’t have to believe, just relax and it’s working. I felt relaxed and better directly after the session.

  response: I enjoyed it, it’s relaxing, and I think it’s possible to get well with this kind of alternative medicine. I had beautiful visions of being young, travelling on a boat and I felt free and peaceful during the healing. I don’t understand how it’s works but I think I saw what happened and it was for me like a healing journey to Japan.

  response: Audrey gave me the power of my favorite animal, the elephant. I love elephant, it’s make me remember my mother, her wisdom. I had to cry. This session showed me I have to take care more of myself.
